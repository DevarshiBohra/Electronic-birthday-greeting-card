# Electronic-birthday-greeting-card
Nerdy electronic birthday greeting card using arduino nano.

The Electronic Birthday Greeting Card is designed to surprise and delight the recipient with a special birthday message displayed on an OLED screen, accompanied by LED lights and a buzzer playing a birthday tune.

Initially, the date will be displayed, followed by an introductory animation of a cat. Then, it will display 'Happy Birthday XYZ'. Simultaneously, the happy birthday tune will be played.

After the tune is completed, an instruction to blow on the microphone will be displayed. Once the recipient blows on the microphone, the LED lights will turn off, representing the blowing out of the candles on a birthday cake.

This will be followed by an outro animation, and a message will be displayed (at least once every 5 iterations). The message will be selected randomly from an array of messages.

All the messages and birthday wishes can be modified in the code accordingly.
